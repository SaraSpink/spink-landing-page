        <h3>About:</h3>
        <p>
          I have a strong background in visual art. I am a maker, ready to transition into a new kind of creative work that reaches people in a different way. I believe that software development is a perfect fit for me! There are so many opportunities to be creative
          with code. The idea that people will be able to interact directly with the tools I create is very appealing. I love solving problems and figuring out how to make things work. I also love language! After college I had the opportunity to spend
          a year abroad teaching English in France. Learning to live in a foreign country and becoming fluent in it's language is a similar kind of problem solving to learning and writing code. Now, at the beginning of my coding journey, I am reveling
          in learning something new every day, overcoming challenges, and rediscovering my self-confidence. I love the way development dovetails with the work Iâ€™ve done so far in my life. I'm finding that it is creating an opportunity to pick up my existing
          skill set, enhance it, and move forward. Thank you for taking a little time to get to know me!
