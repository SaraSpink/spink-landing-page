        <h3><em><strong>About:</strong></em></h3>
        <p>
          I have a strong background in visual art. I am a maker, ready to transition into a new kind of creative work that reaches people in a different way. I believe that software development is a perfect fit for me! There are so many opportunities to be creative
          with code. The idea that people will be able to interact directly with the tools I create is very appealing. I love solving problems and figuring out how to make things work. I also love language! After college I had the opportunity to spend
          a year abroad teaching English in France. Learning to live in a foreign country and becoming fluent in it's language is a similar kind of problem solving to learning and writing code. Now, at the beginning of my coding journey, I am reveling
          in learning something new every day and overcoming challenges. I love the way development dovetails with the work Iâ€™ve done so far in my life. I'm finding that it is creating an opportunity to pick up my existing
          skill set, enhance it, and move forward. Thank you for taking a little time to get to know me!

                <p id="specialpadding"> I am a student at <span class="darktealtext">Epicodus</span> in Portland, Oegon. We are currently learning about <span class="darktealtext">Git</span>, <span class="darktealtext">HTML</span>, and <span class="darktealtext">CSS</span>. I got interested in coding because I wanted to develop a new skill that could help me further my career. I love that "aha!" moment when I overcome a challenge. I am looking forward to learning more programming languages and figuring out what I can do with them. The possibilities seem endless!
                </p>

                <p id="specialpadding"> Besides coding my hobbies include kayaking, cycling, drawing, knitting, and spending time with friends, my partner Jared and our dog Ollie. I'll be real with you; I am writing extra text here because I am practicing using CSS stylesheets to float an image and have the text wrap around it! And it seems to be working! I would also like to share a few things I have been working on in class so far. They are a bit rough but I have definitely learned a lot so far.
